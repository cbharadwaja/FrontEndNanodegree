You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
I have worked on HTML during my experience, I am into this course to get a strong understanding of JavaScript to learn frontend frameworks.

* What has been easy?

The index.html file with placeholder HTML code has made it easy to complete the project.
  
* What has been difficult?

Initally it was difficult to figure out the links in the index.html file. But looking through the HTML thouroughly, I was able to identify the links and proceed.

Yes, I was able to understand the HTML tree structure better. I started using sublime text editor for my frontend projects.
